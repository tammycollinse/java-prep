//These are some java notes
//This is from coursera

//This is core Java Specialization
//Introduction => features and benefits, fundamentals
//Introduction to OOP
//Deep dive into OOP

//MODULE INTRODUCTION AND BENEFITS OF JAVA

//Write One Run Anywhere (WORA)
//OO
//Familiar C/C++ based syntax
//rich libaries
//security
//performance
//its free
//community process for expanding java

//Java App is hosted on Java Virtual Machine
//The code is compiled into an intermediate format called architecture neutral bytecodes
//developers write code for the java platformrather than a specific platform

//byte codes are executed by the JVM and the bytecode instructions are translated into native machine code by the JRE
//Java runtime environment

//THE PROCESS OF COMPILATION TO EXECUTION
//Java source file => compiler => java bytecode => bytecode verifier class loader JIT compiler (this is the JRE)=> native code, OS, Hardware platform

//Taking a look at key benefits: PACKAGES, syntax and libaries
//a package is some neutral classes => think of a package like a directory
//just as windows directories are seperates by the backslash, the nodes of Jaca packages are structured and seperated by dots
//e.g package com.learnquest.calculator.util;
//packages help us group files and classes more meaningfully

//for each primitive, there is a wrapper class, there are object literals with data types

//Java has LIBRARY STANDARD
//these lirbabries are based on the standards developed within and by the Java community
//JCP => java community process defines:
//a specification of the API , interfaces and required behavior
//designed to enhance portablity by promoting vendor independence


//  DATABASE CONNECTIVITY, Java Database Connectivity 
//JDBC packages are a key offering found in java.sql
//thisn package facilitates database neutral interaction with a relational database
//theb packages provides a set of interfaces that have been standardized by the JDBC specification
